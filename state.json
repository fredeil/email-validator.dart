Repository is now in great shape with CI, CONTRIBUTING.md, README docs, and unit tests all in place. New issue #76 about TLD validation scope - commented to explain this is by design (syntax validator, not TLD existence checker). New monthly summary created as #77. Next priority: watch for new issues; consider feature proposal for optional TLD allowlist (motivated by #76)."
